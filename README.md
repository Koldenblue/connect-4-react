Connect 4, programmed in React, and playable at the <a href='https://connect-4-react.herokuapp.com/'>deployed website</a>! Connect 4 has been a popular game for decades - a simple web search will turn up the game rules for any users unfamiliar with the game. The website is a simple browser game which utilizes React components and algorithmic logic in JavaScript to enable interactivity. The app currently offers fairly basic functionality, with the ability for 2 players to take turns, and a notification when one player wins (gets four pieces in a row). Future direction may include integration into a website consisting of a larger collection of games. Additional functionality that could be programmed includes win trackers, ability to play online, or ability to play against an AI.

This project was translated to React from a project originally written (also by me) using vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and the jQuery library. The original, older deployed website can be found <a href='https://koldenblue.github.io/games-websites/'>here</a>, and the source code may be viewed in the <a href='https://github.com/Koldenblue/games-websites'>original GitHub repository</a>.
